Succesfully charaterized (Raman Spectroscopy and PL analysis) and fabricated TMD heterostructures for further plasmonic enhancement using silver nanoparticles. Worked with WSe2 and MoSe2 and build them and test their properties through different techniques:

- Optical Microscopy
- Raman Spectroscopy
- Photoluminescence (PL)
- Atomic Force Microscopy
