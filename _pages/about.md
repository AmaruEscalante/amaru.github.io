I'm a builder with a passion for generative AI, computer vision, and entrepreneurship. I've co-founded two ventures, [Warden](http://wardentec.com) (originally warden.la) and [Luteach](https://luteach.com). I invest my time in building projects like [FotosAI](https://www.fotosai.xyz)

As a researcher, I've worked at the intersection of electronics, machine learning and quantum materials. My research spans from practical engineering applications to material science.

# My Publications
Here are some of my key publications:

- **Plasmonic Enhancement of Single Quantum Emitters in TMDs Heterostructures** (2020)  
  Research on quantum matter devices at Purdue University, focusing on TMD heterostructures and their interaction with silver nanoparticles.
